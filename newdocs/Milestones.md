### Repository & delivery

- **Official source:** PhoenixClaw organization repository (e.g. `PhoenixClaw/phoenix`). All development and deployment use this repo as the source of truth.
- **Do not push to the earlier/original repository.** All pushes go to the PhoenixClaw org repo only.

---

## Phase 1 — Foundation (Weeks 1–8)

Phase 1 establishes the core platform: new repository, infrastructure, authentication, dashboard shell with all tab placeholders, database schema, first OpenClaw instance, and the execution pipeline for placing trades. By the end of Phase 1, you can create a basic agent via the dashboard, see it on an OpenClaw instance, and place a paper trade through the execution queue. See [Architecture Plan §3 Service Registry](ArchitecturePlan.md#3-service-architecture) and [§4 Database Architecture](ArchitecturePlan.md#4-database-architecture).

**Deliverables:**
- Execution Service in `services/execution/`:
  - Consumes `stream:trade-intents` (Redis Streams consumer group)
  - 3-layer risk validation:
    1. **Agent-level**: Does this trade match the agent's allowed instruments, position size, and daily limit?
    2. **Execution-level**: Is the order valid (quantity, price, market hours)? Duplicate check (idempotency by intent ID).
    3. **Global-level**: Is the account under its daily loss limit? Is the circuit breaker closed?
  - Order placement via broker connector (Alpaca first)
  - Order status tracking (submitted → partial → filled / rejected)
  - Publishes result to `stream:position-updates`
- Global Position Monitor in `services/global-monitor/`:
  - Tracks total exposure per account
  - Enforces daily loss limits per account
  - Circuit breaker: opens when daily loss > 3%, blocks new orders
  - Emergency kill switch: close all positions when portfolio loss > 10%
- API endpoints:
  - `POST /api/v2/trade-intents` — Submit trade intent (for testing/manual)
  - `GET /api/v2/execution/status` — Service health and queue depth
  - `POST /api/v2/execution/kill-switch` — Emergency: close all positions

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Trade intent processed within 500ms of arrival in queue

**Owner:** Backend Engineer + AI Engineer
**Status:** Done

**Description:**
Build the sandboxed backtesting engine that evaluates agent performance on historical data before allowing promotion to paper/live trading.

**Deliverables:**
- Backtest Runner in `services/backtest-runner/`:
  - Docker-in-Docker execution (sandboxed, no host access)
  - Three backtest types:
    1. **Signal-driven**: replay historical signals from a connector, let agent evaluate each
    2. **Heartbeat-driven**: simulate strategy agent heartbeat on historical data
    3. **Walk-forward**: rolling window train/test with strategy optimization
  - Market data provider: fetch OHLCV bars from Alpaca/Yahoo Finance, cache in TimescaleDB
  - Metric calculation engine: total PnL, win rate, Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, max drawdown, profit factor, Calmar ratio, average trade duration, profit per trade
  - Result storage: JSON summary + equity curve + trade log → MinIO
- Backtest API:
  - `POST /api/v2/backtests` — Start backtest (agent_id, type, date range, config)
  - `GET /api/v2/backtests/:id` — Status and progress (% complete, current date)
  - `GET /api/v2/backtests/:id/results` — Full results and metrics
  - `GET /api/v2/backtests/:id/trades` — Paginated trade log
  - `GET /api/v2/backtests/:id/equity-curve` — Equity curve data
- Dashboard integration (Agent detail page → Backtesting sub-tab):
  - Start backtest button with configuration form
  - Progress bar with live log stream
  - Results display: metric cards, equity curve chart (Recharts), trade log table
  - Compare backtests side-by-side

**Acceptance Criteria:**

  ```
  CREATED → BACKTESTING → BACKTEST_COMPLETE → REVIEW_PENDING
    → PAPER_APPROVED → PAPER_TRADING → LIVE_APPROVED → LIVE_TRADING
    → PAUSED (from any active state)
    → ERROR (from any state)
    → RETIRED (terminal state)
  ```
- Automatic backtest trigger on agent creation
- Review gate:
  - Dashboard shows backtest results with a "Promote to Paper" or "Reject" button
  - Rejection requires a reason (stored in audit log)
  - Promotion minimum criteria (configurable): win rate > 50%, Sharpe > 1.0, max drawdown < 20%
- Paper trading:
  - Agent connected to paper trading account
  - Real-time tracking but no real money
  - Performance compared against backtest predictions
- Live trading promotion:
  - Requires admin approval if paper results diverge > 20% from backtest
  - Admin review with side-by-side backtest vs. paper metrics
- Status transitions logged in `audit_log` table
- Dashboard indicators: clear status badges, progress bar through lifecycle

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] New agent automatically starts backtesting
- [x] Backtest completion triggers notification and review prompt
- [x] Cannot promote agent that fails minimum criteria
- [x] Paper trading agent tracks real-time PnL without placing real orders
- [x] Live promotion requires explicit admin approval

## Concurrent Build Matrix

After Phase 1 is complete (or at least through M1.11), Phase 2 and Phase 3 can be built in parallel using three workstreams. Dependencies between workstreams (e.g. M2.7 depends on M2.4, M2.5) remain as in the Dependency Graph; within each stream, order by the graph.

| Workstream | Focus | Milestones |
|---|---|---|
| **A — Backend / services** | Skill sync, backtesting, connectors, agent comms, monitoring, automations, observability | M2.2, M2.3, M2.8, M2.10, M2.13, M2.14, M3.5, M3.6, M3.12 |
| **B — Frontend / dashboard** | Performance tab, Skills tab, Market Center, Dev Dashboard, Task Board, Admin tab, Network viz, PWA | M2.7, M2.9, M2.12, M3.3, M3.4, M3.7, M3.8, M3.10 |
| **C — OpenClaw / skills / agents** | 30 + 85 skills, lifecycle, trading/strategy agents, brokers, Dev Agent, RL, code gen, walk-forward | M2.1, M2.4, M2.5, M2.6, M2.11, M2.15, M3.1, M3.2, M3.9, M3.11 |

## Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| OpenClaw API changes in new version | High | Medium | Pin OpenClaw version, abstract all OC calls behind Bridge Service |
| Broker API rate limits during high-volume trading | High | Medium | Queue-based execution with backoff, multiple broker accounts |
| LLM latency spikes (Claude/GPT-4) | Medium | High | Cache common evaluations, use faster models for simple decisions, timeout + fallback |
| WireGuard VPN instability | High | Low | Automatic reconnection, heartbeat monitoring, fallback to direct HTTPS with mTLS |
| PostgreSQL disk full | High | Low | TimescaleDB retention policies, alerts at 85%, archive to MinIO |
| Agent makes catastrophic trade | Critical | Low | 3-layer risk checks, circuit breaker, kill switch, max position size, daily loss limit |
| Single point of failure (Coolify server) | High | Low | Daily backups, documented recovery procedure, can rebuild from Docker images + DB backup in < 1 hour |
| Skill sync conflict (simultaneous edits) | Low | Medium | Version-based sync with conflict detection, last-write-wins with audit trail |
| RL Dev Agent makes wrong fix | Medium | Medium | Destructive actions require admin approval, rollback capability, RL penalty for bad fixes |
| Scope creep in Phase 2-3 | Medium | High | Strict milestone scope, cut features to "future" rather than delaying phase |
