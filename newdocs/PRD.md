## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Vision

Project Phoenix v2 is an autonomous multi-agent trading platform that uses a custom web dashboard as a centralized control plane to orchestrate multiple OpenClaw instances. Each OpenClaw instance runs specialized AI agents that handle data ingestion, trade signal evaluation, backtesting, strategy execution, risk management, and position monitoring. The platform follows the principle that **LLMs should be strategy engineers, not discretionary traders** — every agent must prove its worth through backtesting before touching real capital.

### 1.2 Goals

- **Centralized Control, Distributed Intelligence**: A single dashboard manages all agents across multiple OpenClaw instances running on separate VPS/local machines.
- **Agent-First Architecture**: Every trading decision flows through an AI agent that has been backtested and approved. No agent trades live without passing through the full lifecycle (backtest → review → paper → live).
- **Signal-Agnostic Ingestion**: Consume signals from Discord channels, Reddit, Twitter/X, Unusual Whales, news APIs, and custom data sources.
- **Robust Execution**: Agents never place orders directly. All trades flow through a queue-based execution pipeline with a dedicated broker execution service for reliability and auditability.
- **Paired Agent Architecture**: Every trading agent is paired with a monitoring agent that watches positions and manages exits.
- **Skill Reuse Without Duplication**: A centralized skill repository syncs to all OpenClaw instances, so skills are authored once and available everywhere.
- **Self-Improving System**: A Dev Agent with reinforcement learning continuously monitors all agents, detects failures, auto-fixes code, tunes parameters, and evolves strategies over time.
- **Agent Collaboration**: Agents communicate with each other across instances to confirm signals, share analysis, and increase trade probability through consensus.
- **Bidirectional Communication**: Users interact with agents through Discord, Telegram, and WhatsApp — both for receiving alerts and for issuing commands/tasks.
- **Trading Firm of Agents**: Agents operate as a virtual trading firm with specialized roles (Day Trader, Technical Analyst, Risk Analyzer, Market Research Analyst) that can create and manage their own tasks.
- **Mobile-Friendly**: The entire dashboard is responsive and usable on mobile devices with PWA capability.

### 1.3 Key Differentiators

| Aspect | Traditional Bots | Phoenix v2 |
|---|---|---|
| Decision making | Hard-coded rules or raw LLM "vibes" | Backtested, approved AI agents with structured evaluation |
| Architecture | Single monolith | Distributed OpenClaw instances with specialized agent roles |
| Trade execution | Direct broker calls from bot | Queue-based pipeline with dedicated execution service |
| Position management | Basic stop-loss | Dedicated monitoring agent per trading agent |
| Strategy development | Manual coding | AI-engineered strategies with automated backtesting |
| Skill management | Per-bot configuration | Centralized skill repo synced to all instances |
| Self-improvement | None — manual intervention | Dev Agent with RL continuously monitors, fixes, and evolves agents |
| Agent collaboration | Isolated bots | Agents talk to each other to confirm signals and build consensus |
| User interaction | Dashboard only | Bidirectional via Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, and dashboard |
| Code generation | Human-written only | Agents write Python code, build predictive models, run calculations |

### 1.4 Non-Goals (v2 Scope)

- Mobile native app (responsive web with PWA — not native iOS/Android)
- High-frequency trading (sub-second latency)
- Cryptocurrency DEX execution (CEX and traditional brokers only)

### 2.2 OpenClaw Instance Topology

Four logical OpenClaw instances, deployable across 1-N physical machines:

| Instance | Role | Agents | Tool Allowlist |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A: Strategy Lab** | Build, test, and validate strategies | Strategy Builder, Code Generator, Unit Test Fixer, Backtest Analyst | `write-file`, `run-tests`, `run-backtest`, `read-file` |
| **B: Data & Research** | Fetch and cache market data, interpret news/sentiment | Data Planner, Data Fetcher, News/Sentiment Analyst | `get-data`, `cache-data`, `get-news`, `browse-web` |
| **C: Promotion & Risk** | Rank strategies, enforce risk limits, manage deployments | Strategy Selector, Risk Supervisor, Deployment Manager | `score`, `gate`, `deploy`, `kill-switch` |
| **D: Live Trading Ops** | Execute trades and monitor positions | Live Trader (Stocks), Live Trader (Options), Trade Monitor, Incident/Recovery | `place-order`, `cancel`, `get-positions`, `get-quotes` |

### 2.3 Communication Flow

```
Dashboard API
     │
     ▼
Job Queue (Redis + BullMQ)
     │
     ▼
Orchestrator Worker (state machine with retries)
     │
     ▼
Event Bus (Redis Streams / NATS)
     │
     ├──► OpenClaw Instance A (Strategy Lab)
     ├──► OpenClaw Instance B (Data & Research)
     ├──► OpenClaw Instance C (Promotion & Risk)
     └──► OpenClaw Instance D (Live Trading Ops)
            │
            ▼
      Broker Execution Service
            │
            ▼
      Orders & Positions Store
```

The Event Bus is the backbone. Every OpenClaw instance publishes status updates, trade signals, and position changes back to the bus. The Orchestrator Worker consumes these events, updates the database, and pushes real-time updates to the dashboard via WebSocket/SSE.

### 2.4 Intelligence-in-OpenClaw Principle

All intelligence lives in OpenClaw agents. The dashboard is a control plane and display layer — it does not make trading decisions, run strategies, or execute analysis. The backend API orchestrates jobs, manages state, and relays data. OpenClaw instances are the compute nodes where all AI reasoning, evaluation, code generation, model training, and decision-making happen.

This separation means:
- Adding new intelligence = adding/updating OpenClaw agents and skills (no backend code changes)
- The dashboard can be rebuilt or replaced without affecting trading operations
- OpenClaw instances can operate independently if the dashboard goes down (agents continue trading, queuing results)

### 2.5 1-Minute Heartbeat Orchestration

The dashboard stays current through a 1-minute heartbeat cycle:

```
Every 60 seconds:
    │
    ├─ Backend polls each OpenClaw instance Bridge Service:
    │   GET /heartbeat
    │   Response: {
    │     agents: [{ id, status, current_task, pnl_today, positions, last_trade }],
    │     instance_health: { cpu, memory, uptime },
    │     recent_events: [{ type, agent_id, data, timestamp }]
    │   }
    │
    ├─ Backend aggregates all instance responses
    │
    ├─ Updates database (agent statuses, positions, metrics)
    │
    └─ Pushes delta to dashboard via WebSocket
        → Frontend updates all visible components in-place
```

For time-critical updates (trade fills, position changes, alerts), the Event Bus provides sub-second push via WebSocket/SSE in addition to the heartbeat cycle.

### 2.6 Why Queue-Based Execution (Not Direct)

Agents push trade intents to the execution queue rather than calling broker APIs directly. This is the recommended architecture for the following reasons:

1. **Reliability**: If the broker API is down, trades queue up and retry. Direct calls from an agent would fail silently or require complex retry logic inside the LLM context.
2. **Auditability**: Every trade intent is logged before execution. The execution service records the full lifecycle: intent → validation → order → fill → confirmation.
3. **Rate limiting**: Broker APIs have rate limits. A central execution service can throttle and batch orders across all agents.
4. **Risk checks**: The execution service applies final risk checks (max position size, daily loss limit, circuit breakers) before placing orders. This is a hard safety net that cannot be bypassed by any agent.
5. **Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate orders if an agent retries or if two agents produce the same signal.

## 3. Dashboard Tabs

The dashboard is the single pane of glass for the entire platform. It has 10 primary tabs, each serving a distinct function. Tab visibility is controlled by RBAC — not all users see all tabs.

### 3.1 Trades Tab

**Purpose**: Shows every trade signal that has moved through the pipeline, regardless of which agent or account generated it. This is the "message log" of the trading system.

**Key Views**:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| Timestamp | When the signal was generated |
| Agent | Which trading/strategy agent produced the signal |
| Ticker | Symbol (e.g., AAPL, SPY 450C 03/15) |
| Action | BUY / SELL / CLOSE |
| Source | Data source that triggered the signal (e.g., Discord #options-flow, Reddit r/wallstreetbets, Strategy Heartbeat) |
| Status | `queued` → `evaluating` → `approved` → `executing` → `filled` / `rejected` / `failed` |
| Entry Price | Price at signal generation |
| Fill Price | Actual execution price |
| Account | Trading account assigned |
| PnL | Realized PnL (if closed) |

**Filters**: By agent, by account, by status, by ticker, by date range, by source.

**Real-Time**: New trades stream in via WebSocket. Status transitions animate in place.

**UI Components**:
- Sortable data table (reuse existing `Table` primitive with `TanStack Table`)
- Status badge with color coding: green (filled), yellow (evaluating/queued), red (rejected/failed), blue (executing)
- Expandable row showing full trade detail: agent reasoning, evaluation logs, execution timestamps, broker response

### 3.2 Positions Tab

**Purpose**: Account-centric view of all open and recently closed positions. This tab answers "what is each trading account holding right now?"

**Key Views**:

**Open Positions Table**:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| Account | Trading account name + mode (paper/live) |
| Ticker | Symbol |
| Side | LONG / SHORT |
| Qty | Number of shares/contracts |
| Entry Price | Average entry |
| Current Price | Real-time (polling every 5s) |
| Unrealized PnL | Current profit/loss |
| PnL % | Percentage change |
| Agent | Which agent opened this position |
| Monitor Agent | Which monitoring agent is watching this |
| Stop Loss | Current stop level |
| Time Held | Duration since entry |
| Actions | Manual close button, adjust stop |

**Closed Positions Table** (toggleable):
- Same columns plus Exit Price, Realized PnL, Exit Reason (stop-loss, take-profit, agent decision, analyst close, EOD)

**Account Summary Cards** (top of page):
- Total account value
- Day PnL (dollar + percentage)
- Open positions count
- Buying power remaining
- Win rate (today / all-time)

**UI Components**:
- Flex cards for account summaries (reuse `Card` primitive)
- Data table with real-time price updates
- Color-coded PnL (green positive, red negative)
- Sparkline per position showing intraday price movement (Recharts `AreaChart`)

### 3.3 Performance Tab

**Purpose**: Deep analytics across all accounts, agents, and strategies. A long scrollable page of tables and metrics.

**Section 1 — Account Performance**:

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| Total PnL | By account, sortable |
| Win Rate | Percentage of profitable trades |
| Sharpe Ratio | Risk-adjusted return |
| Max Drawdown | Largest peak-to-trough decline |
| Profit Factor | Gross profit / gross loss |
| Average Win / Average Loss | Dollar amounts |
| Best Day / Worst Day | Calendar view option |

**Section 2 — Top/Bottom Agent Performers**:
- Table: Top 10 agents by PnL (all time, this month, this week, today)
- Table: Bottom 10 agents by PnL
- Per-agent metrics: trade count, win rate, average hold time, Sharpe, max drawdown

**Section 3 — Agent-Account Matrix**:
- Cross-reference table showing which agents are assigned to which accounts and their performance in each
- Heatmap visualization: rows = agents, columns = accounts, cell color = PnL intensity

**Section 4 — Source Performance**:
- Which data sources (Discord channels, Reddit subs, etc.) produce the most profitable signals
- Table: source name, signal count, conversion rate (signal → trade), average PnL per signal

**Section 5 — Time-Based Analysis**:
- PnL by hour of day (bar chart)
- PnL by day of week (bar chart)
- Cumulative equity curve (line chart, Recharts `LineChart`)
- Monthly returns grid (calendar heatmap)

**Section 6 — Strategy Performance** (for strategy agents):
- Strategy name, backtest Sharpe, live Sharpe, divergence score
- Comparison: backtest results vs. live results

**UI Components**:
- Multiple `Card` sections with embedded `Table` components
- Recharts for all charts (AreaChart, BarChart, LineChart)
- Toggle between time ranges (today / week / month / YTD / all-time)
- Export to CSV button per table

### 3.4 Agents Tab (Trading Agents)

**Purpose**: Create, configure, monitor, and manage OpenClaw trading agents. This is the primary agent management interface.

**3.4.1 Agent List View**

The default view shows all trading agents as data-rich flex cards in a responsive grid (3-4 per row on desktop, 1 on mobile).

**Each Agent Card Displays**:
- Agent name + status badge (`backtesting` / `pending_review` / `paper_trading` / `live` / `paused` / `error`)
- Data source (e.g., "Discord: #swing-trades @TraderX")
- Current PnL (total + today)
- Trade count (total / today)
- Win rate
- OpenClaw instance it's running on
- Last activity timestamp
- Sparkline of recent PnL (last 7 days)

**Actions on Card**:
- Click → Agent Detail Page
- Quick actions: Pause / Resume / Stop / Assign Account

**"New Agent" Button** (top right):
Opens a multi-step creation wizard:

```

### 3.5 Strategy Agents Tab

**Purpose**: Create and manage rule-based strategy agents. Unlike trading agents (which react to external signals), strategy agents follow predefined algorithmic strategies and run on heartbeat schedules.

**3.5.1 Strategy Library**

A list of 30-40 pre-built strategy templates:

| Category | Strategies |
|---|---|
| Momentum | RSI Reversal, MACD Crossover, Breakout Momentum, 52-Week High Breakout, Relative Strength |
| Mean Reversion | Bollinger Band Bounce, RSI Oversold/Overbought, VWAP Reversion, Gap Fill |
| Trend Following | Dual Moving Average, ADX Trend, Ichimoku Cloud, Supertrend |
| Options | Iron Condor Weekly, Covered Call, Wheel Strategy, Straddle on Earnings, 0DTE Scalp |
| Volume | Volume Spike, OBV Divergence, Relative Volume Breakout, VWAP Cross |
| Sentiment | Put/Call Ratio Extreme, VIX Mean Reversion, Fear & Greed Contrarian |
| Multi-Factor | Momentum + Value, Quality + Low Vol, Sector Rotation, Pairs Trading |
| Intraday | Opening Range Breakout, First Pullback, VWAP Scalp, Pre-Market Gap |
| Event-Driven | Earnings Drift, FDA Approval, Dividend Capture, Index Rebalance |

**3.5.2 Strategy Agent Creation**

**Step 1 — Select Strategy**: Pick from library or create custom.

**Step 2 — Configure Parameters**:
- Instrument universe (e.g., S&P 500, NASDAQ 100, specific tickers)
- Timeframe (1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, daily)
- Strategy-specific parameters (e.g., RSI period=14, overbought=70, oversold=30)
- Position sizing rules
- Entry/exit conditions

**Step 3 — Backtesting** (automatic):
- Agent immediately begins backtesting on creation
- Pulls historical data for the configured instruments and timeframe
- Runs the strategy against 2 years of data (configurable)
- Generates full performance report

**Step 4 — Review**:
- If backtest results are poor (negative PnL, Sharpe < 0.5), agent is flagged
- User reviews metrics and decides: approve for paper, reject, or reconfigure

**Step 5 — Paper/Live Assignment**:
- Assign to paper trading account
- After paper trading period, promote to live

**3.5.3 Strategy Agent Runtime**

Strategy agents differ from trading agents in execution model:

- **Heartbeat-driven**: Agent runs on a cron schedule (e.g., every 5 minutes during market hours)
- **Self-contained**: Agent pulls its own data, runs strategy logic, and pushes trade signals to the execution queue
- **No external trigger**: Does not wait for Discord messages or external signals
- **Continuous data logging**: Writes strategy state, signals, and decisions to a shared database/file that the dashboard reads

```
HEARTBEAT.md (for a strategy agent):

## Active Strategy: RSI Reversal on SPY
- Every 5 minutes during 9:30 AM - 3:50 PM ET (weekdays):
  1. Fetch latest SPY 5-minute bars
  2. Calculate RSI(14)
  3. If RSI < 30 and no open position: generate BUY signal
  4. If RSI > 70 and holding: generate SELL signal
  5. Log decision to /workspace/strategy_log.jsonl
  6. If signal generated: POST to execution queue API
- At 3:50 PM: Close all open positions (EOD rule)
```

### 3.6 Connectors Tab

**Purpose**: Configure and manage all external data sources, trading accounts, and API integrations.

**3.6.1 Data Source Connectors**

### 3.7 Skills & Agents Config Tab

**Purpose**: Two-section page for managing the centralized skill repository and editing agent configurations across all OpenClaw instances.

**3.7.1 Skills Section**

**Skill List**:
- Searchable, filterable grid of all available skills
- Each skill card shows: name, category, description, installed instances, version
- Filter by category: Data, Analysis, Execution, Risk, Monitoring, Utility

**Skill Detail** (click to expand):
- Full description
- Required tools (e.g., `shell`, `browser`, `python`)
- Input parameters
- Output format
- Version history
- Which agents are currently using this skill

**"Add Skill" Flow**:
1. Browse ClawHub marketplace (3000+ community skills)
2. Upload custom SKILL.md
3. Create from template

**Skill Distribution**:
- When a skill is added to the central repository, a sync job pushes it to all connected OpenClaw instances
- Per-instance toggle: enable/disable specific skills per instance
- Conflict resolution: central version wins, with option to pin instance-specific overrides

**How Centralized Skills Work** (avoiding duplication):
```
Central Skill Repository (S3/MinIO or Git repo)
        │
        ├──► Sync Agent on OC Instance A
        │    └──► ~/.openclaw/skills/phoenix/
        │
        ├──► Sync Agent on OC Instance B
        │    └──► ~/.openclaw/skills/phoenix/
        │
        └──► Sync Agent on OC Instance C/D
             └──► ~/.openclaw/skills/phoenix/
```

Each OpenClaw instance has a lightweight sync agent (cron job or file watcher) that pulls from the central repository. Skills are stored in a `phoenix/` subdirectory within each instance's managed skills folder (`~/.openclaw/skills/`). This gives them second-highest precedence (below workspace skills, above bundled skills).

**3.7.2 Agents Config Section**

**Agent Configuration Editor**:
- List of all agents across all OpenClaw instances
- Click to edit any agent's configuration:
  - AGENTS.md content (system prompt, role, goals)
  - SOUL.md content (personality, communication style)
  - TOOLS.md content (allowed tools)
  - MEMORY.md content (long-term knowledge)
  - Assigned skills
  - Heartbeat/cron schedule
  - Risk parameters

**Bulk Operations**:
- Update a skill across all agents that use it
- Change risk parameters for all agents in an instance
- Pause/resume all agents in an instance

### 3.8 Market Command Center Tab

**Purpose**: Full-featured market intelligence dashboard migrated from the existing Phoenix v1 project. Provides 50+ configurable widgets for real-time market monitoring.

**Layout System**:
- `react-grid-layout` with `ResponsiveGridLayout` (12-column grid)
- Responsive breakpoints: lg 1200, md 996, sm 768, xs 480, xxs 0
- Row height 40px, margins 8px, drag-and-drop via `.drag-handle`
- Multiple tabbed canvases (Overview, Day Trading, Options, etc.) — users create/rename/delete/duplicate tabs
- Layouts persisted to localStorage (`mcc-tabs-v2`) and optionally synced to server

**Widget Categories** (carried over from existing `pages/MarketCommandCenter.tsx`):

| Category | Widgets |
|---|---|
| Market Pulse | Fear & Greed Index, VIX, Market Breadth, Market Clock, Ticker Tape, Symbol Info, Trading Session |

**Configurable Widgets**: Widgets like TradingView Chart, VIX, Technical Analysis, GEX, Options Flow allow symbol customization via `TickerSearch` component.

### 3.9 Admin & User Management Tab

**Purpose**: Role-based access control, user management, and system audit log. Restricted to admin and manager roles.

**3.9.1 User Management** (carried over from existing `pages/Admin.tsx` and `pages/AccessManagement.tsx`):

**User Table**:
- Email, name, role, status (active/inactive), last login
- Promote/demote admin
- Toggle active/inactive
- Export CSV

**Roles** (5 built-in, extensible with custom):

| Role | Access Level |
|---|---|
| `admin` | Full access to all tabs, settings, kill switch, Dev Dashboard |
| `manager` | All tabs except Dev Dashboard and system config, can approve agents for live |
| `trader` | Trades, Positions, Performance, Agents (view only), Market Command Center |
| `viewer` | Read-only access to Trades, Positions, Performance |
| `custom` | Per-permission granular assignment |

**Tab Visibility Control**: Each role defines which dashboard tabs are visible. Similar to AutoRabit's access model — admins configure per-role tab access from a matrix UI.

**3.9.2 API Key Vault**

A secure, centralized location to manage all integration credentials:

| Key Type | Fields |
|---|---|
| Broker (Alpaca) | API Key, API Secret, Base URL, Mode (paper/live) |

- Entries: timestamp, user, action, target, details
- Actions logged: user role changes, agent approvals, kill switch activations, config changes, Dev Agent auto-fixes, connector modifications
- Filterable by user, action type, date range
- Exportable to CSV

### 3.10 Agent Network Visualization (Admin Panel)

**Purpose**: A visual, interactive graph showing the entire agent network — all OpenClaw instances, agents within each, their statuses, and inter-agent communication flows. Admin-only.

**Implementation**: Built with `@xyflow/react` (already a dependency in the existing project).

**Visualization**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐

```

**Node Types**:
- Instance nodes (containers) showing VPS name, role, health metrics
- Agent nodes within each instance showing name, status color, current task

**Status Colors**:
- Green: active and healthy
- Yellow: backtesting or paper trading
- Red: error or paused
- Gray: stopped or dormant
- Blue: processing a task

**Edge Types**:
- Solid lines: active communication channels between agents
- Dashed lines: configured but idle connections
- Animated edges: real-time message flow

**Interactions**:
- Click any agent node to open its detail panel (logs, positions, config)
- Click any instance node to see instance health, agent list, resource usage
- Hover over edges to see recent messages between agents
- Zoom, pan, and minimap for large agent networks

**Real-Time Updates**: Agent statuses and message flows update via WebSocket, reflecting the 1-minute heartbeat data plus sub-second event bus pushes.

## 4. OpenClaw Integration

### 4.1 Instance Management

The dashboard manages OpenClaw instances as first-class entities:

**Registration**:
```json
{
  "instance_id": "oc-strategy-lab-01",
  "name": "Strategy Lab (VPS-1)",
  "host": "10.0.1.10",
  "port": 18790,
  "role": "strategy_lab",
  "agents": [],
  "status": "online",
  "cpu_usage": 45,
  "memory_usage": 2048,
  "max_agents": 20
}
```

**Health Monitoring**:
- Heartbeat ping every 30 seconds
- CPU/memory metrics via system agent
- Agent count and status per instance
- Auto-alert on instance going offline

### 4.2 Agent Creation via Dashboard

When a user creates an agent via the dashboard, the following sequence executes:

```
1. Dashboard → Backend API:
   POST /api/v2/agents
   {
     "name": "Discord Options Trader",
     "type": "trading",
     "data_source": { "type": "discord", "channel_id": "123456" },
     "skills": ["signal_parser", "options_evaluator", "risk_calculator"],
     "instance_id": "oc-live-ops-01",
     "risk_config": { "max_position": 5000, "stop_loss_pct": 20 }
   }

2. Backend API → Job Queue:
   Enqueue job: CREATE_AGENT

3. Orchestrator Worker:
   a. Generate AGENTS.md from template + config
   b. Generate TOOLS.md based on assigned skills
   c. Generate HEARTBEAT.md (if strategy agent)
   d. SSH/API call to target OpenClaw instance
   e. Create agent workspace: ~/.openclaw/agents/<agent_id>/
   f. Write config files to workspace
   g. Register agent in openclaw.json bindings
   h. Start agent process

4. OpenClaw Instance → Event Bus:
   Publish: AGENT_CREATED { agent_id, instance_id, status: "active" }

5. Orchestrator → DB:
   Update agent record: status = "backtesting"
   (Backtest job is auto-enqueued)
```

### 4.3 OpenClaw API Bridge

A lightweight bridge service runs alongside each OpenClaw instance. It exposes a REST API that the Orchestrator can call:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/agents` | GET | List all agents on this instance |
| `/agents` | POST | Create new agent (accepts config files) |
| `/agents/:id` | GET | Agent status, metrics, logs |
| `/agents/:id` | PUT | Update agent configuration |
| `/agents/:id` | DELETE | Remove agent |
| `/agents/:id/pause` | POST | Pause agent execution |
| `/agents/:id/resume` | POST | Resume agent execution |
| `/agents/:id/logs` | GET | Stream agent activity logs |
| `/agents/:id/sessions` | GET | List agent sessions |
| `/skills/sync` | POST | Trigger skill sync from central repo |
| `/health` | GET | Instance health metrics |

### 4.4 Multi-Instance Skill Distribution

```
Central Repository (Git or S3)
         │
    ┌────┴────┐
    │ Webhook │  (on push/update)
    └────┬────┘
         │
    POST /skills/sync to each instance
         │
    ┌────┼────────────┬────────────┐
    ▼    ▼            ▼            ▼
  OC-A  OC-B        OC-C        OC-D
  (pulls latest)   (pulls latest) ...
```

Each instance's sync handler:
1. Pulls the latest skill bundle from the central repo
2. Compares checksums to detect changes
3. Updates `~/.openclaw/skills/phoenix/` directory
4. Restarts affected agents if skill files changed

---

## 5. Agent Lifecycle

Every agent follows a strict lifecycle. No agent touches real capital without passing through all gates.

                                    └──────────────┘
```

### 5.1 State Definitions

| State | Description | User Action Required |
|---|---|---|
| `CREATED` | Config written, agent not yet running | None (auto-transitions) |
| `BACKTESTING` | Agent is running against historical data | Wait for completion |
| `FAILED` | Backtest crashed or timed out | Review logs, reconfigure |
| `PENDING_REVIEW` | Backtest complete, awaiting user approval | Approve or reject |
| `REJECTED` | User rejected backtest results | Reconfigure and re-backtest |
| `PAPER_TRADING` | Agent trading on paper account | Monitor performance |
| `LIVE` | Agent trading on live account | Monitor, can pause/stop |
| `PAUSED` | Agent temporarily halted | Resume or stop |
| `STOPPED` | Agent permanently deactivated | Delete or reconfigure |

### 5.2 Backtest-to-Live Gate Criteria

Before an agent can be approved for paper trading, the dashboard displays these metrics with pass/fail indicators:

| Metric | Minimum Threshold | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Total Signals | >= 50 | Must have evaluated enough signals for statistical significance |
| Win Rate | >= 45% | Percentage of profitable trades |
| Profit Factor | >= 1.2 | Gross profit / gross loss |
| Sharpe Ratio | >= 0.5 | Risk-adjusted returns |
| Max Drawdown | <= 30% | Largest peak-to-trough |
| Average Hold Time | context-dependent | Reasonable for strategy type |

These are recommendations, not hard blocks. The user can override and approve agents that don't meet all thresholds, with a warning dialog.

### 6.2 Agent Evaluation Process

When a trading agent receives a signal (e.g., a Discord message saying "AAPL 180C 03/15 looking strong, entry around $3.20"):

1. **Parse**: Extract ticker (AAPL), instrument type (call option), strike (180), expiration (03/15), suggested entry ($3.20)
2. **Sentiment Check** (skill: `sentiment_analyzer`): Analyze the message tone, author track record if available
3. **Technical Check** (skill: `technical_analyst`): Pull current AAPL price, check RSI, MACD, support/resistance levels
4. **Options Chain Check** (skill: `options_chain_analyzer`): Verify the contract exists, check bid-ask spread, open interest, implied volatility, Greeks
5. **Unusual Activity Check** (skill: `unusual_whales_flow`): Check if there's unusual options activity confirming the thesis
6. **Risk Calculation** (skill: `risk_calculator`): Calculate position size based on account balance, existing exposure, max risk per trade
7. **Decision**: The agent's LLM synthesizes all skill outputs and makes a TAKE/PASS decision with written reasoning
8. **If TAKE**: Format a trade intent and push to the execution queue

### 6.3 Paired Monitoring Agent

Every trading agent is paired with a monitoring agent. When a trade is filled, the monitoring agent is notified and begins tracking the position.

**Monitoring Agent Responsibilities**:

| Responsibility | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Stop-loss enforcement | Default 20% from entry. Virtual stop (agent checks price and sends close order). Hard stop on broker side as backup. |
| Take-profit monitoring | Configurable target. Agent evaluates whether to take profit or let it run based on momentum. |
| Trailing stop | Once position is +15% or more, move stop to breakeven. At +25%, trail at 10% below high. |
| EOD close | For intraday strategies: close all positions by 3:50 PM ET. |
| Signal-based exit | If the original data source publishes a close/exit signal, the monitoring agent processes it. |
| Analyst close | If the Discord/Reddit analyst says "closing AAPL calls," the monitor triggers a close. |
| Time-based review | Every 30 minutes, the monitor re-evaluates the thesis. If conditions changed materially, recommend close. |

**Monitoring Agent Decision Matrix for Exits**:

```
IF position PnL <= -20%:
    → CLOSE (hard stop-loss, non-negotiable)

IF position PnL >= +30%:
    → Evaluate: trail stop or take profit
    → Use momentum skill to decide
    → If momentum fading: CLOSE
    → If momentum strong: TRAIL at -10% from high

IF time_held > max_hold_time:
    → CLOSE (avoid overnight risk for intraday)

IF analyst_exit_signal received:
    → CLOSE (trust the source)

IF thesis_invalidated (news, technical breakdown):
    → CLOSE (cut losses regardless of current PnL)

OTHERWISE:
    → HOLD (no action needed)
```

### 6.4 Speed Requirements

Trading agents must evaluate signals fast enough to capture the trade before the price moves significantly.

| Step | Target Latency |
|---|---|
| Message ingestion (connector → queue) | < 500ms |
| Agent evaluation (all skills) | < 10 seconds |
| Execution queue processing | < 500ms |
| Order placement (broker API) | < 2 seconds |
| **Total signal-to-order** | **< 15 seconds** |

To meet these targets:
- Use cached market data (refresh every 30-60 seconds)
- Pre-load skill contexts into agent memory
- Use fast LLM models for evaluation (Claude Haiku / GPT-4o-mini for speed, Claude Sonnet / GPT-4o for complex decisions)
- Execution service maintains persistent broker connections

### 6.5 Agent Code Generation & Predictive Models

Trading and strategy agents are not limited to prompt-based reasoning. Using OpenClaw's `python` and `shell` tools, agents can:

**Write and Execute Code**:
- Generate Python scripts for custom technical analysis calculations
- Build data pipelines to fetch, transform, and analyze market data
- Create one-off analysis scripts (e.g., "calculate the correlation between AAPL and SPY over the last 30 days")

**Build Predictive Models**:
- Train small ML models (linear regression, gradient boosting, simple neural networks) for price direction prediction
- Use scikit-learn, XGBoost, or PyTorch within sandbox environments
- Models are versioned and stored in the Artifact Store (MinIO)
- Other agents can load and use trained models via the `load_model` skill

**Example Flow**:
```
Agent receives task: "Build a model to predict SPY direction based on VIX and put/call ratio"
    │
    ├─ Agent writes Python script using skill: python_executor
    │   - Fetches historical data (VIX, PCR, SPY returns)
    │   - Trains a gradient boosting classifier
    │   - Evaluates accuracy on test set
    │   - Saves model to artifact store
    │
    ├─ Agent reports: "Model trained. Test accuracy: 62%. AUC: 0.67."
    │
    └─ Model available to other agents via: load_model("spy_direction_v1")
```

All code execution happens in sandboxed environments (Docker containers with no host access) to prevent any damage to the system.

## 7. Strategy Agent Architecture

### 7.1 How Strategy Agents Differ from Trading Agents

| Aspect | Trading Agent | Strategy Agent |
|---|---|---|
| Trigger | External signal (Discord, Reddit, etc.) | Internal heartbeat/cron |
| Data source | Messages from connectors | Market data APIs directly |
| Decision model | LLM evaluates human-generated signals | Algorithmic rules (with optional LLM oversight) |
| Frequency | Event-driven (whenever a signal arrives) | Time-driven (every N minutes) |
| Independence | Depends on external data quality | Self-contained |

### 7.2 Runtime Model

Strategy agents run in their assigned OpenClaw instance with a HEARTBEAT.md file that defines their schedule:

```markdown
## Strategy: RSI Reversal — SPY, QQQ

### Schedule
- Active: weekdays 9:30 AM - 3:50 PM ET
- Frequency: every 5 minutes

### On Each Tick
1. Fetch 5-minute bars for SPY, QQQ (last 100 bars)
2. Calculate RSI(14) for each
3. Check for entry signals:
   - RSI crosses below 30 from above → BUY signal
   - RSI crosses above 70 from below → SELL signal (if holding)
4. If signal:
   - Calculate position size (max 5% of account per trade)
   - POST trade intent to execution queue
   - Log: ticker, RSI value, signal type, size
5. If no signal:
   - Log: "No signal. SPY RSI=52.3, QQQ RSI=48.7"

### EOD Rule
- At 3:50 PM: close all open positions for this strategy
- Log daily summary: trades taken, PnL, final RSI values

### Data Output
- Write all logs to /workspace/strategy_logs/<date>.jsonl
- Write current state to /workspace/strategy_state.json
```

### 7.3 Strategy Data Pipeline

Strategy agents write their state and logs to files/database that the dashboard reads:

```
Strategy Agent (OpenClaw)
    │
    ├──► /workspace/strategy_state.json
    │    {
    │      "strategy": "RSI Reversal",
    │      "instruments": ["SPY", "QQQ"],
    │      "positions": [{"ticker": "SPY", "side": "long", "entry": 450.2}],
    │      "last_check": "2026-03-03T14:30:00Z",
    │      "signals_today": 3,
    │      "pnl_today": 127.50
    │    }
    │
    ├──► /workspace/strategy_logs/2026-03-03.jsonl
    │    (append-only log of every tick and decision)
    │
    └──► POST /api/v2/strategy-heartbeat
         (periodic push to dashboard API for real-time display)
```

The dashboard polls the strategy heartbeat API or receives WebSocket pushes to update the Strategy Agents tab.

## 8. Position Monitoring

### 8.1 Architecture

Position monitoring is a two-layer system:

**Layer 1 — Per-Agent Monitoring Agent** (OpenClaw):
- Each trading/strategy agent has a paired monitoring agent
- Runs in the same OpenClaw instance
- Has full context of the trading agent's thesis and reasoning
- Makes intelligent exit decisions (trailing stops, thesis invalidation)

**Layer 2 — Global Position Monitor** (Backend Service):
- Aggregates all positions across all agents and accounts
- Enforces hard limits (daily loss, max exposure, circuit breakers)
- Cannot be overridden by any agent
- Kills all trading if total portfolio loss exceeds threshold

### 8.2 Stop-Loss Strategy

| Level | Trigger | Action | Overridable |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hard stop-loss | Position PnL <= -20% | Immediate market close | No |
| Soft stop-loss | Position PnL <= -10% | Agent re-evaluates, may close | Yes (agent decides) |
| Trailing stop | Position PnL was >= +15%, now dropped 10% from high | Close to lock in profits | No |
| Time stop | Position held > max hold time | Close regardless of PnL | No |
| Daily loss limit | Account daily loss >= -5% | Pause all agents on account | No |
| Portfolio circuit breaker | Total portfolio loss >= -10% in one day | Kill switch: close ALL positions, pause ALL agents | No |

### 8.3 Exit Decision Flow

```
Every 30 seconds (monitoring agent loop):
    │
    ├─ Fetch current price for all monitored positions
    │
    ├─ For each position:
    │   ├─ Calculate unrealized PnL
    │   ├─ Check hard stop-loss (-20%) → CLOSE if hit
    │   ├─ Check trailing stop → CLOSE if triggered
    │   ├─ Check time stop → CLOSE if exceeded
    │   ├─ Check for exit signals from data source
    │   │   └─ If analyst said "close" → CLOSE
    │   ├─ Every 30 minutes: full thesis re-evaluation
    │   │   ├─ Re-run technical analysis
    │   │   ├─ Check for adverse news
    │   │   └─ If thesis broken → CLOSE
    │   └─ If none of above: HOLD
    │
    └─ Report status to dashboard via heartbeat
```

### 8.4 Profit-Taking Strategy

When a position is profitable, the monitoring agent uses a graduated approach:

| PnL Range | Behavior |
|---|---|
| 0% to +15% | Hold. Let the trade develop. |
| +15% to +25% | Move stop to breakeven. Agent begins watching for momentum fade. |
| +25% to +50% | Trail stop at 10% below the high water mark. |
| +50% to +100% | Take partial profits (close 50% of position). Trail remainder at 15% below high. |
| > +100% | Take 75% profits. Trail final 25% at 20% below high. |

The monitoring agent can also close based on momentum analysis — if RSI shows divergence, volume is declining, or the broader market is reversing, it may recommend closing even within "hold" ranges.

## 9. Dev Agent & Reinforcement Learning

### 9.1 Dev Agent Overview

The Dev Agent is a specialized OpenClaw agent with elevated permissions that continuously monitors all other agents in the system. It operates as the "AI managing AI" — detecting failures, diagnosing root causes, auto-fixing code, tuning parameters, and learning from outcomes via reinforcement learning.

The Dev Agent runs in OpenClaw Instance C (Promotion & Risk) with access to all agent workspaces, logs, and performance data. It has its own dedicated workspace and memory.

### 9.2 Monitoring Duties

The Dev Agent continuously gathers data on every strategy and trading agent:

| Monitored Metric | Trigger Condition |
|---|---|
| Win rate | Drops below historical average by > 15% |
| Consecutive losses | 5+ losing trades in a row |
| Drawdown | Exceeds 10% in a single day |
| Trade frequency | Abnormally high or zero trades (stall detection) |
| Error rate | Any runtime exceptions or API failures |
| Strategy drift | Live performance deviates from backtest by > 2 standard deviations |
| Latency | Signal-to-order time exceeds 30 seconds |
| Agent health | Agent process not responding to heartbeat |

### 9.3 Issue Detection and Diagnosis

When an anomaly is detected, the Dev Agent follows a structured diagnosis flow:

```
Anomaly Detected
      │
      ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. GATHER CONTEXT               │
│  - Last N trades of the agent    │
│  - Agent's strategy parameters   │
│  - Error logs / stack traces     │
│  - Market regime at time of      │
│    failure                       │
│  - Connector health status       │
└──────────────┬───────────────────┘
               │
               ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│  2. CLASSIFY ISSUE               │
│  - Software bug (exception)      │
│  - Strategy underperformance     │
│  - External failure (data feed)  │
│  - Market regime mismatch        │
│  - Configuration error           │
└──────────────┬───────────────────┘
               │
               ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│  3. DETERMINE ACTION             │
│  - Fix code (Self-Debugging)     │
│  - Tune parameters (Optimizer)   │
│  - Pause agent                   │
│  - Reduce position sizes         │
│  - Restart connector             │
│  - Switch to backup data source  │
│  - Recommend human review        │
└──────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 9.4 Reinforcement Learning Feedback Loop

The Dev Agent treats each intervention as an action in an RL environment:

**State Space**: Vector representation of the troubled agent's recent performance — win rate, PnL trajectory, trade frequency, error count, market regime classification, time of day.

**Action Space**: The set of possible interventions — tweak parameter (which parameter, by how much), pause agent, reduce size, fix code, switch data source, do nothing.

**Reward Function**: Measured change in the target agent's performance in the period following the intervention:
- Positive reward: agent PnL improves, win rate recovers, errors stop
- Negative reward: agent PnL worsens, new errors introduced, unnecessary pause cost opportunity

**Algorithm**: Q-learning or policy gradient (PPO) trained on accumulated intervention history. State-action-reward tuples are stored and used for batch updates.

**Learning Loop**:
```
OBSERVE agent performance metrics (state)
    │
    ▼
SELECT intervention action (policy)
    │
    ▼
EXECUTE intervention (fix, tune, pause)
    │
    ▼
WAIT observation period (1 hour to 1 day)
    │
    ▼
MEASURE outcome (reward)
    │
    ▼
UPDATE policy (Q-values or policy weights)
    │
    ▼
REPEAT
```

Over time, the Dev Agent learns patterns like:
- "Mean reversion agents lose in strong trends — pause them when ADX > 40"
- "Widening stop-loss by 0.5% fixes short-squeeze losses better than pausing"
- "Data feed errors resolve in < 5 minutes — wait before escalating"

### 9.5 Auto-Repair and Code Generation

When the Dev Agent detects a software bug:

1. **Retrieve** the error traceback and recent agent code
2. **Analyze** using LLM (Self-Debugging skill) — identify the bug
3. **Generate** a code fix (patch to the skill or script)
4. **Test** the fix in sandbox (run against recent data)
5. **Apply** the hot-patch to the agent's skill file in OpenClaw
6. **Verify** the agent resumes normal operation

For performance issues, the Dev Agent can:
- Use the Parameter Tuning skill to grid-search better values on recent data
- Run a quick backtest to validate before applying
- Generate entirely new strategy variations by modifying existing code

### 9.6 Dev Dashboard (Admin-Only)

A dedicated admin-only page showing the Dev Agent's activity:

**Incident Feed**:
- Chronological list of all detected issues
- Each entry: timestamp, agent affected, issue type, severity, action taken, outcome
- Status: `detected` → `diagnosing` → `fixing` → `monitoring` → `resolved` / `escalated`

**RL Metrics Panel**:
- Cumulative reward over time (chart)
- Action distribution (pie chart — how often each intervention type is chosen)
- Success rate per action type
- Policy confidence scores

**Code Changes Log**:
- Every code fix the Dev Agent has applied
- Diff view: before/after for each patch
- Rollback button per change

**Agent Health Matrix**:
- Grid of all agents with color-coded health scores
- Click to see the Dev Agent's assessment of each agent
- Recommendations queue: fixes waiting for admin approval (for high-impact changes)

**Performance Comparison**:
- Before/after metrics for each Dev Agent intervention
- Shows whether the system is actually improving over time

## 10. Agent-to-Agent Communication

### 10.1 Why Agents Need to Talk

A trading agent receiving a headline about AAPL earnings can make a better decision if it can:
1. Ask the Options Flow agent: "Is there unusual call activity on AAPL right now?"
2. Ask the Technical Analysis agent: "What are AAPL's key support/resistance levels?"
3. Ask another Trading agent: "Are you also seeing bullish signals on AAPL from your sources?"

This consensus-building increases the probability of successful trades and reduces false signals.

### 10.2 Communication Architecture

**Same-Instance Communication** (agents on the same OpenClaw instance):
- OpenClaw's built-in `agentToAgent` messaging via shared sessions
- Direct memory sharing through workspace files
- Low latency (< 100ms)

**Cross-Instance Communication** (agents on different VPS nodes):
- Event Bus (Redis Streams / NATS) pub/sub topics
- Each agent type has a dedicated topic: `agent.trading.*`, `agent.strategy.*`, `agent.analysis.*`
- Broadcast channel `agent.broadcast` for system-wide alerts
- Latency depends on network (typically < 500ms over WireGuard VPN)

### 10.3 Communication Protocol

All inter-agent messages follow a structured JSON format:

```json
{
  "message_id": "msg_abc123",
  "from_agent": "echo_trading_agent",
  "from_instance": "oc-live-trading-01",
  "to_agent": "options_flow_analyst",
  "to_instance": "oc-data-research-01",
  "intent": "confirm_signal",
  "data": {
    "ticker": "AAPL",
    "direction": "bullish",
    "source": "Discord #earnings-plays",
    "context": "Analyst says AAPL 190C 03/15 looking strong ahead of earnings"
  },
  "response_expected": true,
  "timeout_ms": 5000,
  "timestamp": "2026-03-03T14:30:00Z"
}
```

**Response Format**:
```json
{
  "message_id": "msg_abc124",
  "in_reply_to": "msg_abc123",
  "from_agent": "options_flow_analyst",
  "intent": "signal_confirmation",
  "data": {
    "confirmed": true,
    "confidence": 0.78,
    "supporting_evidence": "Large AAPL call sweeps detected: 5000x 190C 03/15 at $3.40 ask",
    "additional_context": "IV rank 62%, open interest building at 190 strike"
  },
  "timestamp": "2026-03-03T14:30:03Z"
}
```

### 10.4 Communication Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Request-Response** | Agent asks a question, expects a reply | Trading agent asks Options Flow agent for confirmation |
| **Broadcast** | Agent announces to all | Dev Agent broadcasts "Circuit breaker triggered, all agents pause" |
| **Pub-Sub** | Agents subscribe to topics of interest | All trading agents subscribe to `agent.analysis.sentiment` for real-time sentiment updates |
| **Chain** | Sequential consultation across agents | Signal → Sentiment Agent → Technical Agent → Risk Agent → Decision |
| **Consensus** | Multiple agents vote on a trade | 3 agents confirm bullish AAPL → proceed; 1 confirm, 2 reject → pass |

### 10.5 Consensus-Based Trading

For high-conviction trades, agents can use a consensus protocol:

```
Trading Agent receives signal: "AAPL bullish"
    │
    ├─ Sends confirm_signal to Options Flow Agent
    │   Response: confirmed (confidence 0.78)
    │
    ├─ Sends confirm_signal to Technical Analysis Agent
    │   Response: confirmed (confidence 0.65, "above 20 EMA, RSI 55")
    │
    ├─ Sends confirm_signal to Sentiment Agent
    │   Response: neutral (confidence 0.50, "mixed Reddit sentiment")
    │
    ├─ Aggregates: 2/3 confirmed, average confidence 0.64
    │
    └─ Decision: TAKE (threshold met: >= 2/3 confirmations, avg confidence > 0.6)
```

The required confirmation count and confidence threshold are configurable per agent.

## 11. Task Board & Automations

### 11.1 Task Board Overview

The Task Board is a new dashboard tab that operates as a kanban-style board where users create agents with specific roles and assign them tasks. This is different from Trading Agents (which react to data source signals) and Strategy Agents (which follow algorithmic rules). Task Board agents are role-based workers — a virtual trading firm.

**Reused Components**: Built on the existing `SprintBoard` and `TaskDetail` pages from Phoenix v1, using `@dnd-kit/core` and `@dnd-kit/sortable` for drag-and-drop.

### 11.2 Agent Roles

Users create agents from a role template:

| Role | Description | Example Tasks |
|---|---|---|
| **Day Trader** | Executes intraday trades based on assigned tasks | "Trade AAPL momentum today", "Scalp SPY 0DTE calls" |
| **Technical Analyst** | Analyzes charts and produces reports | "Analyze NVDA daily chart", "Find breakout candidates in NASDAQ 100" |
| **Risk Analyzer** | Evaluates portfolio risk and suggests adjustments | "Review portfolio correlation", "Stress test for 5% market drop" |
| **Market Research Analyst** | Researches macro and sector trends | "Summarize Fed meeting implications", "Analyze semiconductor sector outlook" |
| **Options Specialist** | Analyzes options chains and strategies | "Find best iron condor on SPY for this week", "Analyze AAPL earnings straddle" |
| **News Analyst** | Monitors and interprets breaking news | "Watch for FDA announcements today", "Summarize pre-market movers" |
| **Quant Developer** | Builds models and runs data analysis | "Build a momentum factor model", "Backtest pairs trading on MSFT/GOOGL" |
| **Custom** | User-defined role with custom system prompt | Any task the user specifies |

### 11.3 Task Board UI

**Kanban Columns**: Backlog → In Progress → Under Review → Completed

**Task Card Fields**:
- Task title and description (natural language)
- Assigned agent (role + instance)
- Priority (critical, high, medium, low)
- Due date / deadline
- Status
- Output / deliverable (text, file, chart, trade recommendation)
- Labels / tags

**Agent-Created Tasks**: Agents can also create tasks on the board. For example:
- A Market Research Analyst might create a task: "AAPL earnings tomorrow — need options strategy analysis"
- A Risk Analyzer might create: "Portfolio heat approaching 25% — need rebalancing review"

These agent-created tasks appear with an "Agent" badge and can be assigned to other agents or flagged for human review.

### 11.4 Automations Panel

A separate section within the Task Board tab for configuring recurring automations:

**Natural Language Task Input**:
- Text input: "Give me a morning briefing of the stock market every weekday at 8:00 AM"
- System parses into: cron schedule + agent role + task description + delivery channel
- User confirms and edits the parsed configuration

**Automation Configuration**:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Name | "Morning Market Briefing" |
| Schedule | Cron expression or natural language ("every weekday at 8:00 AM ET") |
| Agent Role | Market Research Analyst |
| Instance | Auto-select or specific instance |
| Task Description | "Compile pre-market summary: futures, key earnings, economic events, sector movers" |
| Delivery Channel | Telegram / Discord / WhatsApp / Dashboard notification |
| Active | Toggle on/off |

**Example Automations**:

| Automation | Schedule | Agent Role | Delivery |
|---|---|---|---|
| Morning Market Briefing | Weekdays 8:00 AM | Market Research Analyst | Telegram |
| End-of-Day Summary | Weekdays 4:15 PM | Risk Analyzer | Discord |
| Apple Earnings Analysis | One-shot: March 5 at 7:00 AM | Options Specialist | Dashboard + Telegram |
| Weekly Portfolio Review | Sundays 6:00 PM | Risk Analyzer | Email |
| Options Flow Alert | Every 30 min during market hours | Options Specialist | WhatsApp |
| Sector Rotation Check | Weekly Mondays 9:00 AM | Market Research Analyst | Discord |

**How It Works**:
1. User configures automation in dashboard UI
2. Backend creates a cron job entry in the database
3. At scheduled time, Orchestrator enqueues a job
4. Job is dispatched to an available OpenClaw instance
5. A temporary or permanent agent is spun up with the specified role
6. Agent executes the task, produces output
7. Output is delivered via the configured channel AND stored on the dashboard
8. For one-shot tasks, the agent workspace is cleaned up after delivery

### 11.5 Bidirectional Communication Channels

Users interact with agents through configured messaging platforms:

**Supported Channels**:

| Channel | Send Alerts | Receive Commands | Implementation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Discord | Yes | Yes | OpenClaw native Discord bot account |
| Telegram | Yes | Yes | OpenClaw native Telegram bot account |
| WhatsApp | Yes | Limited (via Meta Cloud API, existing `shared/whatsapp/sender.py`) | Meta Business API |
| Dashboard | Yes | Yes | WebSocket + REST API |

**Outbound** (Agent → User):
- Trade alerts: "Agent Echo bought 100 AAPL @ $185.50"
- Task completions: "Morning briefing ready — [view on dashboard]"
- Warnings: "Portfolio drawdown at 8%, approaching 10% circuit breaker"
- Dev Agent reports: "Fixed Agent Omega's stop-loss calculation bug"

**Inbound** (User → Agent):
- Commands: "Pause agent Echo"
- Tasks: "Analyze TSLA chart for tomorrow"
- Questions: "What is my current portfolio exposure?"
- Overrides: "Close all AAPL positions now"

**Implementation**: OpenClaw natively supports Discord and Telegram as channel types via bot accounts. Each agent can be bound to specific channels in `openclaw.json` bindings. The dashboard backend routes inbound messages to the appropriate agent via the Event Bus.

## 13. Connector Framework

### 13.1 Connector Architecture

All connectors follow a unified interface:

```python
class BaseConnector:
    connector_type: str        # "discord", "reddit", "unusual_whales", etc.
    config: ConnectorConfig    # Credentials, filters, settings
    status: str                # "connected", "disconnected", "error"

    async def connect() -> bool
    async def disconnect() -> None
    async def test_connection() -> ConnectionTestResult
    async def start_ingestion() -> None  # Begin consuming messages
    async def stop_ingestion() -> None
    async def get_historical(start: datetime, end: datetime) -> list[RawMessage]
```

Every connector publishes normalized messages to the event bus:

```json
{
  "id": "msg_abc123",
  "connector_type": "discord",
  "connector_id": "disc_001",
  "source": {
    "server": "Trading Alerts Pro",
    "channel": "#options-flow",
    "author": "TraderX",
    "author_id": "discord_user_456"
  },
  "content": "AAPL 180C 03/15 looking strong, entry around $3.20",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-03T14:30:00Z",
  "metadata": {
    "message_type": "trade_alert",
    "attachments": [],

## 14. Backtesting Engine

### 14.1 Architecture

The backtesting engine runs in a sandboxed environment (Docker/Firejail) to prevent any interference with live systems.

  + Real-time progress to dashboard
```

### 14.2 Backtest Types

**Type 1 — Trading Agent Backtest** (signal-driven):
1. Load historical messages from the configured data source (e.g., 2 years of Discord messages from #options-flow)
2. Replay messages in chronological order
3. For each message, the agent evaluates using its skills (same as live)
4. If agent says TAKE: simulate entry at historical price + configurable slippage
5. Apply exit rules: stop-loss, take-profit, time stop, analyst close signals
6. Record every decision and trade

**Type 2 — Strategy Agent Backtest** (heartbeat-driven):
1. Load historical OHLCV data for configured instruments
2. Simulate the heartbeat schedule (e.g., every 5 minutes)
3. At each tick, run the strategy logic
4. Simulate entries/exits at historical prices
5. Apply all position management rules

**Type 3 — Walk-Forward Backtest**:
1. Split historical data into in-sample (training) and out-of-sample (testing) windows
2. Optimize parameters on in-sample data
3. Validate on out-of-sample data
4. Repeat with rolling windows
5. Report both in-sample and out-of-sample performance

### 14.3 Metrics Calculated

| Metric | Formula/Description |
|---|---|
| Total PnL | Sum of all realized trades |
| Win Rate | Winning trades / total trades |
| Profit Factor | Gross profit / gross loss |
| Sharpe Ratio | (Annualized return - risk-free rate) / annualized volatility |
| Sortino Ratio | (Return - risk-free rate) / downside deviation |
| Max Drawdown | Largest peak-to-trough in equity curve |
| Average Win | Mean profit on winning trades |
| Average Loss | Mean loss on losing trades |
| Win/Loss Ratio | Average win / average loss |
| Expectancy | (Win rate x avg win) - (loss rate x avg loss) |
| Trade Count | Total number of trades |
| Average Hold Time | Mean duration of positions |
| Calmar Ratio | Annual return / max drawdown |
| Recovery Factor | Total PnL / max drawdown |
| Ulcer Index | Measure of downside volatility |

### 14.4 Approval Workflow

```
Backtest Complete
       │
       ▼
Dashboard displays results with pass/fail indicators
       │
       ├─ All metrics PASS → Green "Approve for Paper Trading" button
       │
       ├─ Some metrics FAIL → Yellow warning + "Approve with Caution" button
       │
       └─ Critical metrics FAIL (negative PnL, Sharpe < 0) → Red "Reject" button
       │
       ├─ Approve → Agent moves to PAPER_TRADING state
       │            Requires selecting a paper trading account
       │
       ├─ Reject → Agent moves to REJECTED state
       │           User can reconfigure and re-backtest
       │
       └─ Reconfigure → Edit agent config, auto re-backtest
```

- `md` (768px): two-column layouts where applicable
- `lg` (1024px): full sidebar navigation
- `xl` (1280px): maximum width layouts with spacious grids

**Mobile Navigation**:
- Sidebar collapses to a hamburger menu (`Sheet` component from existing UI)
- Bottom navigation bar for primary tabs (Trades, Positions, Agents, Market)
- Swipe gestures on Task Board kanban columns

**Responsive Patterns**:
- Data tables → horizontal scroll on mobile, or switch to card view for key tables (positions, trades)
- Agent flex cards → single column grid on mobile
- Chart widgets → full-width with touch zoom/pan
- Dialogs → full-screen sheets on mobile (existing `Sheet` component)

**PWA Capability**:
- `manifest.json` for home screen install
- Service worker for offline caching of static assets
- Push notifications via service worker (for trade alerts when app is backgrounded)

### 17.2 Coolify Deployment

**Dashboard + API** (primary Coolify app):
- Docker Compose with: dashboard (nginx + React build), api (FastAPI), PostgreSQL, Redis, NATS/Redis Streams
- Exposed on custom domain (e.g., phoenix.yourdomain.com)
- HTTPS via Coolify's built-in Let's Encrypt

**Supporting Services** (Coolify services):
- Orchestrator Worker
- Execution Service
- Global Position Monitor
- Connector Manager
- Backtest Runner
- Skill Sync Service

**OpenClaw Instances** (separate VPS machines):
- Each instance runs on its own VPS (Hetzner/DigitalOcean)
- OpenClaw + Bridge Service installed via Docker or direct Node.js
- Connected to the central event bus via NATS or Redis Streams over WireGuard VPN
- Health monitored from the dashboard

**Infrastructure Services** (Coolify or dedicated):
- MinIO (artifact store)
- TimescaleDB (time-series data)
- Kafka (if using for high-volume ingestion; otherwise Redis Streams suffices)
- Prometheus + Grafana (observability)

```

### 17.4 Deployment Sequence

1. **Provision infrastructure**: Coolify server + 1-4 VPS for OpenClaw instances
2. **Set up WireGuard VPN**: Secure connectivity between Coolify server and OpenClaw VPS nodes
3. **Deploy core services** on Coolify: dashboard, API, PostgreSQL, Redis, NATS, MinIO
4. **Run migrations**: `alembic upgrade head`
5. **Deploy OpenClaw instances**: Install OpenClaw + Bridge Service on each VPS
6. **Register instances**: Via dashboard API or admin CLI
7. **Sync skills**: Push initial skill catalog to all instances
8. **Configure connectors**: Add Discord, Reddit, Unusual Whales, broker accounts via dashboard
9. **Create first agent**: Test the full lifecycle (create → backtest → review → paper trade)

### 17.5 Code Cleanup from Phoenix v1

When creating the new repository, the following services and code from the existing project should be handled:

**Services to Deprecate** (replaced by OpenClaw skills):

| Service | Replacement |
|---|---|
| `services/nlp-parser/` | OpenClaw skill: `sentiment-classifier`, `trade-signal-parser` |
| `services/sentiment-analyzer/` | OpenClaw skill: `sentiment-classifier`, `social-sentiment-analysis` |
| `services/news-aggregator/` | OpenClaw skill: `fetch-news-headlines`, `news-impact-analyzer` |
| `services/ai-trade-recommender/` | OpenClaw trading agents with evaluation skills |
| `services/signal-scorer/` | OpenClaw skill: `llm-trade-evaluator` |
| `services/option-chain-analyzer/` | OpenClaw skill: `options-chain-analyzer`, `options-greeks-analyzer` |
| `services/twitter-ingestor/` | Connector Framework: Twitter/X connector |

**Services to Keep and Refactor**:

| Service | Action |
|---|---|
| `services/auth-service/` | Keep as-is — handles JWT, MFA, email verification |
| `services/api-gateway/` | Refactor — add v2 routes for agents, strategies, OpenClaw, tasks, automations |
| `services/dashboard-ui/` | Rebuild — new pages/tabs, carry over UI primitives and reusable components |
| `services/discord-ingestor/` | Refactor into Connector Framework interface |
| `services/reddit-ingestor/` | Refactor into Connector Framework interface |
| `services/trade-executor/` | Refactor into Execution Service |
| `services/position-monitor/` | Replace with Monitoring Agent (OpenClaw) + Global Monitor (backend service) |
| `services/trade-parser/` | Convert to OpenClaw skill: `trade-signal-parser` |
| `services/notification-service/` | Expand — add Telegram, keep Discord, keep WhatsApp |
| `services/strategy-agent/` | Replace with OpenClaw Strategy Agents |

**Shared Libraries to Keep**:

| Library | Status |
|---|---|
| `shared/broker/` | Keep — adapter pattern, Alpaca, circuit breaker, symbol converter |
| `shared/crypto/` | Keep — Fernet encryption for API Key Vault |
| `shared/kafka_utils/` | Keep — producer, consumer, DLQ |
| `shared/market/calendar.py` | Keep — market hours, holidays |
| `shared/models/` | Extend — add new entities (Task, Automation, DevIncident, AgentMessage, ApiKeyEntry) |
| `shared/nlp/` | Keep — FinBERT sentiment, ticker extractor (also converted to skills) |
| `shared/discord_utils/` | Keep — channel discovery |
| `shared/unusual_whales/` | Keep — API integration |
| `shared/whatsapp/` | Keep — Meta Cloud API sender |
| `shared/retry.py`, `shared/dedup.py`, etc. | Keep — utility libraries |

**Files to Delete from Existing Repo**:
- All deprecated service directories listed above
- `shared/agents/` (replaced by OpenClaw agent framework)
- `shared/llm/client.py` (replaced by OpenClaw LLM integration)
- `services/source-orchestrator/` (replaced by Connector Manager)
- `services/audit-writer/` (replaced by centralized logging in new architecture)

## 18. Risk & Trade Execution Architecture

### 18.1 Execution Pipeline

The decision to use queue-based execution (agents push intents, execution service places orders) is final. Here is the complete pipeline:

### 18.2 Risk Hierarchy

Three layers of risk control, each operating independently:

**Layer 1 — Agent-Level Risk** (in OpenClaw):
- Configured per agent in risk_config
- Agent's LLM applies these when deciding TAKE/PASS
- Soft enforcement (agent can technically override, but training prevents it)

**Layer 2 — Execution Service Risk** (deterministic code):
- Hard-coded checks before every order
- Cannot be bypassed by any agent or user
- Rules:
  - Max position size per trade: configurable per agent
  - Max concurrent positions per agent: configurable
  - Max portfolio allocation per ticker: 10%
  - Daily loss limit per account: 5% (configurable)
  - Max portfolio heat: 25% (total risk across all positions)

**Layer 3 — Global Position Monitor** (independent service):
- Runs on a separate process, monitors all positions across all accounts
- Kill switch: if total portfolio drops 10% in one day, close everything and pause all agents
- Monitors for stuck orders, positions without monitoring agents, and orphaned trades
- Sends alerts (email, Discord, dashboard notification) for any anomaly

### 18.3 Circuit Breaker States

```
CLOSED (normal operation)
    │
    ├─ Daily loss < 3% → Stay CLOSED
    │
    ├─ Daily loss 3-5% → HALF_OPEN
    │   - Reduce max position sizes by 50%
    │   - Alert user
    │
    └─ Daily loss >= 5% → OPEN
        - No new trades allowed
        - Existing positions monitored with tighter stops
        - User must manually reset
        │
        └─ Daily loss >= 10% → EMERGENCY
            - Close ALL positions immediately
            - Pause ALL agents
            - Requires manual restart and acknowledgment
```
